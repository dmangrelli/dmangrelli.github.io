The boxes get smaller than before
They both float next each-other to the right in the other order
They both float next to each-other to the left side of the page
The boxes set to the right you cant see them when you make the browser window smaller
When setting the divs to right and left there is a big space left in between them
Div1 goes all the way across the page unlike Div2 that stays the same in a horizontal
The Divs get longer in size to fit with in the window after you resize it.
